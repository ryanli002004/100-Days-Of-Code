# 100 Days of Code Challenge

### Done on Visual Studio Code instead of on Replit!
- I used `sqlite3` instead of Replit's own database system.
- I worked on this 100 days of code on three different laptops: two Windows laptops and a Macbook.
- I had a different private repository for each laptop, so I combined all of them into one repository (this one).
- After combining the repositories, I finished the 100 days on the Mac.
