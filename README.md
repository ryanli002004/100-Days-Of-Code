I worked on this 100 days of code on three different laptops, two Windows laptops and a Macbook.
I had a different priavte repository for each laptop, so I combined all of them into one repository(this one).
After combining the repositories, I finished the 100 days on the Mac.
day 1: made a program that prints strings in the console using print statements
day 2: made a program that prints strings in the console using variables
day 3: made a program that prints strings in the console using concatenation
