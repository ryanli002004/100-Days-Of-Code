(easier to read in code mode)
I worked on this 100 days of code on three different laptops, two Windows laptops and a Macbook.
I had a different priavte repository for each laptop, so I combined all of them into one repository(this one).
After combining the repositories, I finished the 100 days on the Mac.
day 1: made a program that prints strings in the console using print statements
day 2: made a program that prints strings in the console using variables
day 3: made a program that prints strings in the console using concatenation
day 4: made a program that prints a sentence using concatenation and inputs
day 5: made a program that uses if statements to see which spongebob character you are similar to
day 6: made a program that checks username and password using if statements
day 7: made a program that uses if statements to check if you are a real fan of spongebob
